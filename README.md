## Java Notes
Revision notes and code examples for Java basics.

I curated all my notes on Java from 1st Year at ITB and assembled them to make a concise resource for exam revision. I should have uploaded it a year ago, but better late than never.

**`_Notes.pdf`** contains most of the theory

**`index.html`** contains code examples sourced from all the `.java` files
